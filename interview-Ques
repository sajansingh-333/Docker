Docker Interview Question.Part-3
1- What is a Docker Registry?
Docker Cloud and Docker Hub are the public registries where these images can be hosted upon.
Docker Data Centre (DDC) can also be used which includes DTR (Docker Trusted Registry).

2- What are the Docker Objects?
Docker Objects are Docker Images, Services, and Docker Containers

3- Can you tell the reasons why Container Networking is so important?
* Containers need to talk to the external world. 
* Reach Containers from the external world to use the service that Containers provide. 
* Allows Containers to talk to the host machine. 
* Inter-container connectivity in the same host and across hosts. 
* Discover services provided by containers automatically. 
* Load balance traffic between different containers in a service.
* Provide secure multi-tenant services.

4- How to create a user-defined Bridge network?
#docker network create your_nw_name

5- How is overlay network different from bridge network?
Bridgeworks on single host overlay support among multiple servers connectivity.

6- What networks are affected when you join a Docker host to an existing Swarm?

7- How shall you disable the networking stack on a container?
#docker run -it --network none alpine sh

8-How to check details of a network in a docker container?
#docker inspect container_ID


9- What is Docker Swarm?
Docker Swarm is native clustering for Docker and it turns a pool of Docker hosts into a single, virtual Docker host. 

10- Can you explain different volume mount types available in Docker?
Volumes are stored in a part of the host filesystem which is managed by Docker (/var/lib/docker/volumes/ on Linux
Bind mounts may be stored anywhere on the host system
tmpfs mounts are stored in the host system’s memory only and are never written to the host system’s filesystem.

11- What is the role of .dockerignore file?

12- What is the purpose of EXPOSE command in Dockerfile?
This is used for port mapping between docker host and docker container.

13- How is ENTRYPOINT instruction under Dockerfile different from CMD instruction?


14- Why Build cache in Docker is so important?
If objects are not changed between two builds of a docker container image, docker can use build cache with becomes time-saver at the time of building the image.

15- What are the most common instructions in Dockerfile?
FROM alpine
MAINTAINER Server Ryan
LABEL: "Application_Environment"="Development"
RUN yum update && yum -y install httpd
RUN mkdir -p /data/servergyan
WORKDIR /data/myscript
CMD python app.py
EXPOSE 80 443
EXPOSE 80/tcp 8080/udp
ADD /root/testfile /data/
COPY . .
ENTRYPOINT ping google.com
VOLUME /appdata:/appdata
USER instruction is used to set the username, group name, UID and GID for running subsequent commands. Else the root user will be used.
ENV APP_DIR /data/
ARG TMP_NAME mycustom_image
ONBUILD RUN yum install httpd
